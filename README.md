# periodicity detection - PMUCOS method

Matlab Code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67314-periodicity-detection-pmucos-method 

PMUCOS discovers all periodic parts of a video sequence

This code is a simple implementation of OF PMUCOS METHOD PROPOSED IN [1].

PMUCOS solves the problem of discovering all periodic segments of a video and of estimating their period in
a completely unsupervised manner. These segments may be located anywhere in the video, may differ in duration, speed, period and may represent unseen motion patterns of any type of objects (e.g., humans, animals, machines, etc).
